This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, clone this repository to your local machine:

```

Then, install the dependencies using the following command:

```

Finally, start the development server by running:
